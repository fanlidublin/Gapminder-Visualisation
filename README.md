# Gapminder-Visualisation
Hans Rosling is a data visualisation legend. His 2006 TED talk, The Best Stats Youâ€™ve Ever Seen, is one of the most viewed videos on the TED website (http://bit.ly/2doLzAY). An updated interactive version of the GapMinder World visualisation used in that demo is available at www.gapminder.org/tools. A poster of the visualisation is reproduced below. In this repository I created an information visualisations that is an homage to Hans Rosling.
